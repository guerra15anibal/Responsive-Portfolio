      <p>My name is Anibal Guerra, just in case you didn't see the big title there. You pronouce it ON_KNEE_BALL
        GER-RA most people have a hard time saying it. I'm 23 and I really enjoy the outdoors when ever I have spare
        time
        between work and school. I am also planning a wedding so things can get pretty difficult. I work in
        the
        automotive industry, just dealing with parts mostly. I also have an associates in applied science for
        automotive.</p>

      <p>This was
        always goint to be my backup plan, but life happened and 4 years later I'm finally starting to pursue what I
        have
        always wanted to do. Coding is something that has peaked my curosity. Building something from nothing is
        just
        such an amzaing feeling. I'm lucking to be able to have this opportunity in my life. Other then building
        things
        from
        nothing I like to go fishing, or camping mostly year round.</p>

      <p>Living in such a small town you usually
        have
        more then one hobby other then fishing and camping. I enjoy building computers and going to the shooting
        range.
        Hobbies
        get pretty expensive, and fast.</p>
